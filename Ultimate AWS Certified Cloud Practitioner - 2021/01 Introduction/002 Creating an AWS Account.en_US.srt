1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,143
So let's go ahead

2
00:00:01,143 --> 00:00:03,990
and create our first AWS account.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,270
So in this instance,

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,610
we're going to be leveraging the free tier on AWS.

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,380
That means that for most of the hands-on labs,

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,750
we're going to try to not spend any money.

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,230
And I will tell you if there's a risk

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,280
of you spending money,

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,113
but most of the things that

10
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:18,390
we'll do in this course will be free, okay?

11
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,560
So first you have to enter

12
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,100
your email address, your password

13
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,120
and choose an account name.

14
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,687
So for me, it will be Stephane-AWS.

15
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:26,350
Next, you have to say that

16
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,400
we're going to use AWS for personal,

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,290
because we're just going to do a training.

18
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,290
Then you give your full name,

19
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,290
your phone number,

20
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,330
your address and so on.

21
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,560
As well as your postal code.

22
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,500
Next, you need to enter your credit card details

23
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,650
and as you can see here,

24
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,760
there's a secure verification that happens.

25
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,710
That means that even though you're not charged

26
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,610
for whenever you're using the free tier,

27
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,843
they will temporarily hold on US dollar or Euro

28
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:50,600
in your currency as a pending transaction

29
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,740
for three to five days

30
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,900
to verify your identity.

31
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,450
So this is something they will hold

32
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,550
and reimburse after three to five days.

33
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,510
So if you enter your credit card here

34
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,360
and see a charge,

35
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,193
don't freak out.

36
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,828
It is just an authorization.

37
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,447
Next, AWS will confirm your identity

38
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,440
by asking you for a phone number

39
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,510
and send you a verification code.

40
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,820
And finally, after verifying your accounts,

41
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,550
you have to choose a support plan.

42
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,830
And it will go with basic support

43
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,880
because it's free

44
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,170
and you don't need any kind of support

45
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,120
because you're learning AWS right now.

46
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,531
So let's complete the signup.

47
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,920
And we are now signed up with AWS,

48
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,740
so we'll click on "go to the management console."

49
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,070
And here, you have the possibility

50
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,480
to enter your root user email,

51
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,451
so the email you used to subscribe with.

52
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,110
And then, finally, enter your password

53
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,140
and you're now logged in into the AWS console.

54
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,830
Congratulations, we are almost ready

55
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,430
to get started with this course.

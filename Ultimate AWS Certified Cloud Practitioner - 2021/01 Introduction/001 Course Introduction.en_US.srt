1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,200
Hello and welcome

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,160
to the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner course.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,140
My name is Stephane Maarek and I will be your instructor.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,050
So, we are starting in five minutes

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,860
but please, try to pay attention to this lecture.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,050
So we are going to prepare for the Cloud Practitioner exam.

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,920
The code is CLF-C01.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,820
It is a challenging certification so,

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,200
this course is going to be long and interesting

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,920
and it is good if you have some basic IT knowledge

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,320
but don't worry if you don't come from an IT background,

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,070
I will explain everything for you as well.

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,230
In this course, we're going to learn a lot.

14
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,770
We will cover over 40 AWS services,

15
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,440
out of the 200 plus that exist in AWS.

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,450
If you are a beginner in IT and AWS,

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,330
do not worry, you are welcome to this course

18
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,600
and you will learn a lot

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,390
but take your time, it's not a race.

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,620
You will learn a lot everyday by doing little by little.

21
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,670
Then, this course is a bit special

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,220
because I want you to learn also by doing.

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,170
It's a key learning technique in this course.

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,410
So, this course will mix both theory lectures

25
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,201
and where necessary, hands on

26
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:04,430
where you can follow along

27
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,950
with me in the course by creating your own AWS account

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,370
and reproducing what I do on screen.

29
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,300
So now, we're preparing for a certification.

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,640
I want to show you the type

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,240
of questions you're going to get.

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,900
So this is sample question from the exam

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,737
which says, "Which AWS "service would simplify

34
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:24,130
"the migration of a database to AWS?"

35
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,400
And we'll have four answers,

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,090
Storage Gateway, Database Migration Service,

37
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,640
EC2 and Amazon AppStream 2.0.

38
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,330
Now, this course is going to cover most of the services.

39
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,550
For example, the first service we will learn in this course.

40
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,270
The second service, the name is obvious,

41
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,780
it is the answer to the question,

42
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,890
that is the correct answer

43
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,470
and we will cover this service as well.

44
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,060
For EC2, we will learn as well

45
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,670
and it is possible in the course

46
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,860
to have services that will be called distractors.

47
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,270
So, they will not be covered in the course

48
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,070
because there are over 200 services in AWS

49
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,540
but they will appear at the exam as a wrong answer.

50
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,490
So in this course,

51
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,550
I wanna focus on the service that I know are core to AWS

52
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,040
and they will come up at the exam

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,860
but I will not focus on explaining to you

54
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,670
the distractors because that would make

55
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,810
too much information into your head.

56
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,210
If you're interested into checking out

57
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,730
the sample questions for the exam,

58
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,963
you can use this link.

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,520
So now that we know a little bit more about the exam,

60
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,200
I want to introduce myself.

61
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,410
My name is Stephane Maarek

62
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,140
and I will be your instructor.

63
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,490
I am nine times certified on AWS out

64
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,800
of 12 certification and that's so far.

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,540
I'll be going for the 12 certifications

66
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,520
hopefully before the end of the year 2020.

67
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,210
I've worked with AWS for many years.

68
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,090
I've built websites, application and streaming platforms

69
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,580
and I've been teaching about AWS for a long time.

70
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,223
I teach about many AWS certifications,

71
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:47,410
CloudFormation, Lambda, EC2 and other courses.

72
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,610
As you can see, over 300,000 students

73
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,930
have learned alongside with me

74
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,500
and I have received over 100,000 reviews.

75
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,140
I think you are in good hands.

76
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,580
So, if you want to connect with me,

77
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,290
you can follow me on LinkedIn,

78
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,860
you can follow me on Medium,

79
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,065
Twitter as well as GitHub.

80
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:04,120
So welcome to AWS.

81
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,500
You are going to get certified

82
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,690
and you are going to get the first certification in AWS,

83
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,180
called the Foundational Certification

84
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,980
for AWS Cloud Practitioner.

85
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,930
This is a great first choice

86
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,480
but this is pretty high level.

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,080
If you want to deepen your knowledge

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,450
and get more technical about AWS then after this course,

89
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,820
I would recommend you tackle the Associate Certifications.

90
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,180
Then if you're really an aficionado of AWS

91
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,990
and want to learn more and more and more,

92
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,290
the Specialty exam

93
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,253
and the Professional exams are really difficult

94
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,770
and will test your in depth knowledge.

95
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,650
In this course,

96
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,483
we're just going

97
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,510
to prepare for the foundational knowledge necessary

98
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,500
to pass with flying colors,

99
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,460
the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner examination.

100
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,750
Finally, I said we're going to practice in this course.

101
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,730
So you may have a question

102
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,280
which is how much will this course cost me?

103
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,007
So this is how much it cost me at the end of this course,

104
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:56,960
$12 and 70 cents but I wanna tell you right away

105
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,910
that most of the services we'll use in this course,

106
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,630
will be within the AWS Free Tier.

107
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,030
So there is a chance for you to have a cost of zero.

108
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,843
Now, if I use a service in this course

109
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:09,380
that will cost you money,

110
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,490
I will mention it and I will leave you the option

111
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,730
to not do the hands on with me and just watch me do.

112
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,940
For example, the most expensive item

113
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,380
in here is the registrar

114
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,140
because I've purchased a domain name.

115
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,230
So, new URL, for example stephaneccp.com.

116
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,090
You can read more about the Free Tier at this URL.

117
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,150
If you're unsure about,

118
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,610
if something is going to cost you money

119
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,090
or not or you can just come back

120
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,790
to this slide and then see,

121
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,520
based on the service we're watching

122
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,710
if it's going to cost you anything or not.

123
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,570
As I mentioned,

124
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,170
most of the services we'll be using

125
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,470
will be within the Free Tier.

126
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,480
So don't worry there,

127
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,300
I'll be guiding you along the way.

128
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,920
I am super happy that you're here

129
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,930
with me in this course

130
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,653
and I wish you a happy learning.

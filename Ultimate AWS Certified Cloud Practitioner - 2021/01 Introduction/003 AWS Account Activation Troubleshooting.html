(can take up to 24 hours, usually few minutes)</p></blockquote><p><strong>After you choose a Support plan, a confirmation page indicates that your account is being activated. Accounts are usually activated within a few minutes, but the process might take up to 24 hours.</strong></p><p>You can sign in to your AWS account during this time. The AWS home page might display a button that shows "Complete Sign Up" during this time, even if you've completed all the steps in the sign-up process.</p><p><strong>When your account is fully activated, you'll receive a confirmation email. After you receive this email, you have full access to all AWS services.</strong></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Troubleshooting delays in account activation</p></blockquote><p>Account activation can sometimes be delayed. If the process takes more than 24 hours, check the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Finish the account activation process.</strong> You might have accidentally closed the window for the sign-up process before you've added all the necessary information. To finish the sign-up process, open <a href="https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html</a> and sign in using the email address and password you chose for the account.</p></li><li><p><strong>Check the information associated with your payment method.</strong> Check <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentmethods" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Payment Methods</a> in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. Fix any errors in the information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contact your financial institution.</strong> Financial institutions occasionally reject authorization requests from AWS for various reasons. Contact your payment method's issuing institution and ask that they approve authorization requests from AWS.<br><strong>Note:</strong> AWS cancels the authorization request as soon as it's approved by your financial institution. You aren't charged for authorization requests from AWS. Authorization requests might still appear as a small charge (usually 1 USD) on statements from your financial institution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Check your email for requests for additional information.</strong> Check your email to see if AWS needs any information from you to complete the activation process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Try a different browser.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Contact AWS Support.</strong> Contact <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/support" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AWS Support</a> for help. Be sure to mention any troubleshooting steps that you already tried.<br><strong>Note:</strong> Don't provide sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, in any correspondence with AWS.<br></p></li></ul><blockquote><p>How to Contact AWS&nbsp;Support?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2019-12-07_10-41-49-22ea24f428bef7e11a7b1a34902ddfe2.png"></p><p><br></p><p>The top right corner will have Support &gt;&nbsp;Support Center. </p><p>Ask them to activate the account, that can take up to 24 hours</p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Where to find more details?</p></blockquote><p>Details can be found here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/</a></p></p></div></div></div></body></html>

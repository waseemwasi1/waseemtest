Welcome to Udemy.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,150
I just wanna make sure that you are ready

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,570
to use the tools correctly to maximize learning potential.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,250
So in this course, I will be speaking at my normal speed,

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,270
but if you think I am too slow,

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,900
you can speed me up up to 2X.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,450
Oppositely, if you think I speak too fast,

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,233
you can decrease my speed up to 0.5X.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,900
Also, I've made sure that this course

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,230
has professional subtitles that you can enable

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,870
on the bottom right using the CC icon.

12
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,040
Finally, you can also use transcripts

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,580
to read alongside the video if that helps you

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,080
maximize your learning.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,300
At some point during the course,

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,330
you Udemy will ask you for some feedback.

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,530
If you are not ready to give a rating yet,

18
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,980
click on Ask Me Later.

19
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,420
Else, you can select a star rating for whatever you want

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,480
and then click on the star when you're done.

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,260
Here you can leave me a small message

22
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,780
telling me what you like about this course

23
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,280
and what you want me to improve.

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,010
When you're done, click on Save and Continue

25
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,500
and you can go ahead with this course.

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,820
I wanna say, your ratings are super important for me

27
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,260
and for new students, so please make sure you leave one

28
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,420
when your ready, okay?

29
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,770
That's all, I will see you in the next lecture.

00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,710
Hi and welcome.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,730
My name is Stephane Maarek and I will be your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,500
So I'm delighted to have you here.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,410
And I really hope that you'll enjoy this course and go all the way through with it.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,500
So this is just a two minutes introduction so we can get to know me and then we'll get started with

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,870
the content itself.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,240
So I am French and so if you hear a small accent this is where it comes from.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,740
From the sweet country of France.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,080
But I've also lived in the United States.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,830
I've lived in Australia and in Portugal and my expertise is going to be around AWS certifications, Apache

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,500
Kafka, data engineering and DevOps.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,830
Why.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,950
Well because in my career I've had the chance to go through jobs many of them such as data analyst big

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,580
data engineer, developer and more recently solutions architects and obviously well today I'm a teacher.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,660
I love to teach.

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,180
This is my passion and I want to help you achieve any goal you may have through online learning.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,300
So before we get started with this course there's two ways you can connect with me.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,360
The first one is on LinkedIn.

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,930
And the second one is on Instagram.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,730
So for LinkedIn, this is where we'll share more professional updates.

21
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,830
I will give you updates around new courses and so on.

22
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,780
And this is where I congratulate my students.

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,460
If for example you finished of course and have a certificate or you passed a certification then this is

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,270
where I would love to hear about it and congratulate you.

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,590
And the second project is Instagram and Instagram is a big project of mine because I love to travel

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,900
the world and I've decided as I travel the world to meet students and so I've already met students.

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,190
And every time I meet the students get coffee I will write about it.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,560
Talk about your achievements.

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,620
Talk about your goals or desires.

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,850
How the course helped you and write a small blog about it.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,570
So if you want to get the chance to meet me or if you want to read about the future students that I

32
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:42,920
meet.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,380
Just follow me on Instagram.

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,720
And this is where you'll get a bit more personal behind the scenes updates.

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,030
Finally just before we get started with this course I want you to set a goal by setting a goal you will

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,040
have a much higher chance of finishing this course and learning a lot.

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,390
So maybe you want to say OK I want to take this course and finish it in three weeks then write it down

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,960
make a plan for it and stick with it.

39
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,990
This is how you learn.

40
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,560
And this is how you'll make the most out of this course.

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,020
So that's it for me.

42
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,850
I hope you will enjoy this course and I will see you in the next lecture.

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,390
Happy learning.
